      <h2>CHALLENGES</h2>
      
      <p>In 2009, the UN-FAO released a report predicting that the world’s population would grow 34% by 2050.
       Among the many challenges posed by a growing world population, a primary challenge will be to ensure an
        adequate food supply for this vast population. This challenge is further complicated as the predominance of
         population growth will occur in regions of the world where food security issues are already rampant. </p>
        
        <p> The predicted increase in global demand for food has brought the agricultural and food production industries
         o the spotlight. As a global community, we will not only need to find ways to produce enough food to feed a
          growing world population, but we will need do so in a way that is sustainable and economically viable.</p>
     
          <p>Like any other business, agricultural business generates profits by producing a product that can be sold
         for a higher price than the total cost of the inputs used to create the products. For farmers to make
          money, they look to maximize yield while using the minimal amount of inputs. The primary inputs in the 
          business of agriculture include, in addition to land and human labour, machinery, seeds, water and
           irrigation systems, herbicides/pesticides and fertilizers. With food prices generally low and
            environmental circumstances necessitating high volumes of agricultural inputs, farmers are struggling
             to ensure that the market value of their products is greater than the cost of their inputs, and so
              farms are struggling to remain profitable.</p>
     
              <p>With global demand for food rising as populations grow, and farmers’ margins tightening, the world of
         agriculture and food production presents a ripe target for disruptive technologies. Sure enough,
          recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of food and agricultural technology 
          start-ups and a parallel increase in investment dollars being funneled towards the sector.</p>
